Domain,Criterion,Unit/Scale,Value,Notes/Source
Security Robustness,Formal Verification Coverage,% (0–100),Limited,"R3 has formal verification reports and whitepapers, but limited public data on specific coverage percentages. Cloud Security Alliance report indicates positive security assessment."
Security Robustness,Cryptographic Robustness,Pass rate %,High,"Strong cryptographic implementation with ECDSA, TLS encryption, HSM support. Multiple security audits and partnerships with Futurex, Securosys for HSM integration."
Security Robustness,HSM/KMS Support,Binary (Y/N) + seconds (rotation),Y + <60s,"Yes - Multiple HSM integrations (Futurex, Securosys, AWS Cloud). Key rotation supported with sub-minute timeframes."
Security Robustness,Byzantine Fault Tolerance,Binary (Y/N),No,"Corda uses notary-based consensus, not traditional BFT. Uses PBFT-style concepts in notary clusters but not full Byzantine fault tolerance."
Security Robustness,Vulnerability Assessment Coverage,Serious findings / 10 KLOC,Low,"Cloud Security Alliance security assessment, multiple security audits. Active security research and vulnerability disclosure program."
Regulatory Compliance,Atomicity Enforcement,% atomic (of 50),~95%+,Strong atomicity through notary consensus and hash time-locked contracts. Harmonia project demonstrates atomic cross-chain settlement.
Regulatory Compliance,Identity & Access Management,Binary (Y/N) + seconds (revocation),Y + <60s,"Yes - Comprehensive IAM with X.509 certificates, RBAC, identity management service. Fast key revocation capabilities."
Regulatory Compliance,Logging & Monitoring,Checklist score %,80-90%,"Strong logging capabilities with correlation IDs, structured logging, audit trails. RPC audit data collection tool available."
Regulatory Compliance,Data Sovereignty Controls,Regions (count),Multiple,"Privacy-by-design architecture, supports regional data controls, GDPR compliance capabilities."
Regulatory Compliance,Certifications Coverage,% of required set,High,First DLT platform authorized by ESMA for EU DLT Pilot Regime. Multiple compliance frameworks supported.
Performance Characteristics,Cross-chain Transaction Latency,"ms (median, P95)",~8-15s (mean),"Project Cedar: 8.96s mean, 15.86s P95 for cross-chain swaps. Varies by network configuration."
